reflection for playlist.js

1. What was the hardest part to understand?
Understanding how in skipSong method including when it uses shift() and how it automatically updates the current song. 

2. How does this code use this to tie data and behavior together?
All methods reference this so that it knows which playlists name/song/currentSong it should be working with.

3. What would you do differently if you wrote this object from scratch?
I would inlude a few additional checks to prevent errors.
